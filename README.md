Kubrick for WordPress
=====================

Kubrick was a theme I made for WordPress. It was adopted as the default theme shipping with WordPress from v1.5 (February 17, 2005) and stayed the offical theme for 7 years. It was ported to well over 30 other platforms as well.

This is its last resting place.
